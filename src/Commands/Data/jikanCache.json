        "about": "Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a \"data dog\": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for \"dog\" (犬 inu) but is also German for \"one\". \"Ein\" may also be short for \"Einstein\", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses."

        "about": "Race: Human\nBirthday: July 15 (Cancer)\nAge: 15 (beginning); 17 (currently)\nHeight: 174-&gt;181 cm\nWeight: 61-&gt;66 kg\nKnown Relatives: Isshin Kurosaki (father), Masaki Kurosaki (mother, deceased), Yuzu Kurosaki (younger sister), Karin Kurosaki (younger sister),  \nTheme Song: \"Number One\" by Hazel Fernandes and Shiro Sagisu.\n\nFor the most part, Ichigo appears like a normal teenage boy, the one exception to that is his spiky, orange hair, a trait which he has been ridiculed about for years. He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power."

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming)."

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n\nDespite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n\nNaruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Boisterous, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n\nVowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n\nIn all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers."

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."

Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.\n\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).\n\nHis goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.\n\nThough a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

        "about": "Age: 19→21\nBirthday: March 2\nZodiac: Pisces\nHeight: 177 cm (5' 9\") → 180 cm (5'11\")\nBlood type: RH-\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates; Baratie (former)\nPosition: Cook\nDevil Fruit: none\nBounty: \nSanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills.\n\n\nSanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more."

After a set of unusual circumstances, he ate the Hito Hito no Mi (Human Human Fruit), which permitted him the ability to speak, think, and, to a limited extent, change into a human.\n\nChopper often acts like a child, but he is an upright friend and companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. He also still has distrust in humankind because of events in his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones.\n\nChopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as \"the emergency food supply\" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being \"cool reindeer that can transform.\""

Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.\n\nNami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.\n\nShe respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the \"mother\" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.\n\nNami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."

His royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.\n\nVegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza. He seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about Freeza destroying his planet from Dodoria, he resolves to take out Freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at Freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). He later battles Freeza with the main cast on Namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to Earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good.\n\nIn Cross Epoch (the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for \"vegetable.\" Trunks, Usopp and Nico Robin are members of his crew.\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)"

Then, all of the damage that he has received in battle into scorching heat (named \"Rising Sun\") and is emitted into the air. The emitted nen transforms into a miniature sun that burns the victim to death. Rising Sun has a very large attack radius, and while Feitan is within his armor he will not be harmed by the fire."

Originally a member of the military, he desired an Automail arm to increase his power. This use of automail for unnecessary procedure was prohibited by the State, and Bald was discharged and became an outlaw, seeking revenge on the military that disbarred him. His automail arm includes two gun barrels and a small knife blade. While hijacking the train, Bald was confronted by Edward, who disabled his arm and defeated the bandits, an exploit which won him permission to take the State Alchemist entry exam. He would later resurface in \"Curse of the Crimson Elixir\" inside the sewers of Eastern City, and then \"Stray Rondo\" to repeat the same crime, only to be put in jail yet again both times by the Elrics.\n\nIn the manga, he's actually part of rebels who against Amestris, possibly from one of the southern bordering country which area had been taken by Amestris during the war.\n\nIn the anime, the event actually is part of a flashback to before Edward became a State Alchemist. Defeating Bald allows the Elrics to take the State Alchemist examination after a grateful Hakuro refers them. In the manga, Edward is already a State Alchemist (and fifteen years old) and returning from Lior. After defeating Bald, Mustang refers Edward to Shou Tucker and his research when Edward wonders if it would be possible to alchemically construct himself new limbs."

Winry begs him to let her be his apprentice, but he defers her to Garfiel instead, even though Winry helped deliver his grandson.\n\nIt is noteworthy that when he found out Winry was the granddaughter of Pinako Rockbell, he flipped out, as apparently he has some memories about the \"Pantheress of Resembool\" that he would rather forget (\"Leopardess of Resembool\" in the dubbed anime).\n\nIn the anime, no mention is made of any desire to build hidden cannons, though he did build one into Paninya's right leg. He refuses to sell an automail arm to a young rich man because it is an arm for a fighter, and the young man does not really need it. At the end of the series, he is seen helping Winry train to become an even better mechanic."

She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her.\n\nShe is proud of her family's name, but she does not like being seen as Rias of the Gremory Family. The reason for her living in the human world (as revealed in Volume 2 of the novels) is because there, everyone sees her as Rias, not as a Devil or as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess. Due to this and the fact that the only men who showed interest in her were interested in her due to being the Heiress of the House of Gremory, Rias soured on the idea of finding a lover, until meeting and falling in love with Issei. According to Akeno, Rias originally said that all men looked the same to her as Rias said that Issei is the only exception due to her thinking of him as cute.\n\nShe thinks of Issei as a special person and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei.\n\nShe enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (from Volume 3 of the novels onward), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all (It is revealed in Volume 3 of the novels that the Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, so Rias is no exception). She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and she claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him.\n\nAfter becoming Issei's girlfriend, Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei and is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but still believes in him and loves him. Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls maidenly feelings toward Issei and balance out Issei's feelings toward each of his lovers/brides. Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead. She developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or other girls tried to seduce him before her she immediately rush to him quickly.\n\nShe holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. When she was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time.\n\nRias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone, Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei.  \n\n\nRias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games.\n\nDue to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance.\n\nEarly in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia.\n\nDue to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita, Rias has developed an obsession with Japan, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip, though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto.\n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"

After having her Sacred Gear removed from her body which resulted in her death, Rias revives her as a Devil under her as her Bishop. She moves into the Hyoudou Residence after Issei rescues her from the Fallen Angels and transfers to Kuoh Academy, where she is in the same class as Issei.\n\nAsia is extremely shy, innocent and fairly inexperienced in things like socializing. Despite being reincarnated as a Devil, Asia still believes in God and follows his teachings such as praying to him and reading the Bible, which would usually result in her getting severe headaches. Even when she was still a human, she harbored no hate towards Devils and treated everyone equally, regardless of what they were.\n\nWhile initially having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a Devil, she has stated that she has found more important things than her faith in God, those things being her new friends, comrades as well as Issei's parents and Issei himself.\n\nAsia became more \"bold\" in her relationship with Issei when the other girls start being intimate and dislikes the idea of being left out. Due to Issei initially viewing her as more of a sister due to his desire to protect her, he didn't ogle her like he did other women, causing her to be sad and develop a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to comparing her looks to the likes of Rias. However, she will get jealous and pinch his cheeks whenever he lusts over other girls. She is shown to desire to be treated as a woman by Issei and to have his erotic behavior directed at her, as she has even shown a desire to bear his children. Asia thinks very highly of Issei and has stated a desire to stay with Issei forever, even being willing to become his servant. Despite being shy, she is shown to be protective of Issei as she will slap someone like Diodora when they insult Issei.\n\nAfter becoming Issei's servant, she has begun to shown more courage and determination in battle, as demonstrated in the Rating Game against Team Rias Gremory, where Asia stayed behind to fight Crom Cruach alone to allow Xenovia and Irina to proceed ahead as well to preserve Issei stamina, with Crom Cruach admiring her courage and guts. During the fight, she even displayed the ability to use magic offensively, in contrast to her past passive self, as she continued to fight Crom Cruach even after Fafnir was defeated, stating that as the servant and future wife of the Red Dragon Emperor, she would keep fighting until the end, which deeply impressed Crom Cruach as he praised her courage and spirit, stating that it was his honor to fight her and Fafnir. \nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEquipment\n\n\n \n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"

She and Irina formed a temporary alliance with Issei, Koneko, Yuuto, and Saji, in which they would retrieve the stolen Excaliburs fragments but would allow Yuuto to destroy one of them. During the fight with Freed Sellzen and Valper Galilei, she reveals herself to be the wielder of Durandal, and quickly turns the tide of battle by destroying the fused Excalibur and cutting down Freed. Following the battle with the Fallen Angel leader Kokabiel, she became a Devil under Rias after finding out that God died.\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was portrayed as an individual with a quiet and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She also prefers not to get involved in problems that do not concern her. While a faithful member of the Church, her beliefs are flexible enough to accept help from a Dragon such as receiving a free lunch (after Irina spent all their money on a fake painting of a Saint), and wanting to not only accomplish their mission, but survive afterwards as well. After Volume 3, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they previously met. Like Asia, as a person who was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school.\n\nAs a Knight, Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds, which, combined with the destructive powers of Durandal, makes her a formidable fighter. She also has the ability to tap into Durandal's holy aura with other swords, evident when she uses it with Issei's Ascalon (Issei allows her to use it since he is not a good swordsman and because she cannot fully control Durandal).\n\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wikia)"

She was born between a human father and a Nekomata mother named Fujimai. Her father was a scientist who did not acknowledge Koneko or was aware that she was his child, and merely used her for experiments. Her parents eventually died in an experiment accident. However, her older sister Kuroka, omitted the truth and any other details about them from Koneko to protect her.\n\nAfter losing her parents, she and her sister were later taken in by an unnamed Devil from the branch family of the House of Naberius, who reincarnated her sister as one of the members of his peerage. However, Kuroka's power as a Nekomata supposedly soon grew out of control, eventually causing her to kill her master and become a Stray Devil on the run from her pursuers. In actuality, he had planned to experiment on Koneko in his research about creating a Super Devil, causing Kuroka to kill him in order to protect her younger sister.\n\nFollowing the incident and the failed manhunt that came after, Koneko was sentenced to death by the Devils in hopes of preventing another incident like Kuroka's from happening. However, Sirzechs Lucifer, one of the Four Great Satans, protected her and left her under his sister Rias' care. Due to the trauma, she experienced with her sister's betrayal and murder of her master, she fell into a deep depression, eventually robbing her of nearly all of her emotions until Rias helped her out of it. It was around that time Rias gave Koneko her name and made Koneko her servant. \n\nDue to witnessing her sister supposedly losing control over her nekomata power and killing her master, Koneko became traumatized by the event, causing her to become withdrawn into herself and stripping her of most of her emotions. As a result, Koneko originally had a quiet and cold personality, rarely showing any feelings or emotions, even when she was speaking. It is noted that her serious personality is a result of receiving influence from Rias and is contradictory to her sister's mischievous personality. She was also the only one in the group who did not initially get along with Issei, often insulting and rebuking the latter for his perverted nature, although she reveals that she respects him for never giving up and considers him a hard worker.\n\nShe shows the most concern for her comrades when they are in trouble, often lending her strength in fights. Koneko apparently has a problem with people calling her a midget (although the context of the phrase could be used to be called flat, as in bust size), as shown in her second battle against Freed Sellzen. This may stem from her insecurity about her own small body and bust size.\n\n\n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"

He also harbors a great hatred towards the holy sword Excalibur.\n\nYuuto made his appearance in Volume 1, bringing Issei to the Occult Research Club under Rias' orders.\n\nAs a Knight, Kiba possesses superhuman speed and is heavily skilled in swordsmanship, what Issei has called God-Speed.\n\nKiba's primary weapon is the Sacred Gear \"Sword Birth,\" which has the ability to create an infinite number of Demon Swords at his disposal, such as the Holy Eraser and Flame Delete. He later obtains a sub-species Balance Breaker called \"Sword of Betrayer,\" which is a fusion of a Demonic and a Holy Sword.

        "about": "Birthday: July 21\nHeight: 168 cm (5'6\")\nWeight: 54 kg (119 lbs)\nBWH: 102/60/89\nEye Color: Violet\nRank: Low-Class Devil (Volume 1 - Volume 11), Middle-Class Devil (Volume 12 - True Volume 3), High-Class Devil (True Volume 4 - Present)\nRole: Queen\nRace: Reincarnated Devil (Former Fallen Angel/Human Hybrid)\nFirst Appearance: Volume 1\nAffiliations:\n\nA third-year student and one of the \"Two Great Onee-samas\" of Kuou Academy along with Rias. Called the ultimate \"Queen\" by other members. Born between a human mother and fallen angel father, after the death of her mother, she became Rias' servant. She is a friend close enough to call Rias by her name in private, yet calls her Buchou in presence of others and displays a master-servant relationship in public. She persistently refuses to use her power of light, inherited from her father, but starts using it after being convinced by Issei.\n\nShe is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However underneath her calm atmosphere, she is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain.\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother be killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels. She has developed a sense of self-loathing towards her Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her was mother killed which led her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. Due to this reason, she emphasizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare as she was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature but fell in love with him after he told her he still liked her. With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. Due to Issei helping her, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feeling for him.\n\nWhile she originally had no interest in dating men due to her past, she began to take an interest in Issei, thinking of him as a cute junior and that interest intensified after seeing his determination in the Rating Game against Riser Phenex and his actions during Rias' engagement ceremony, where he defeated Riser Phenex. She has stated that Issei is the first boy she has ever felt such feelings for as she is shown to have a desire to further her relationship with him. She also loves to tease Issei and Rias, as she loves to make Rias irritated by flirting with Issei. Akeno has also stated that she has some masochism in her as well, as she is only masochistic towards Issei in contrast to her sadistic nature in battle. She is shown to be quite vulgar, flirting with Issei as such and doesn't care if Rias knows or saw her doing the act as she tried to have sex with him while also trying to help Issei further his relationship with Rias, but does care enough to not steal him away from her as she even helped Issei confess to Rias. After falling in love with him, she becomes very seductive and is obsessed with having an affair with Issei whenever she finds a chance, which is often interrupted by Rias and some others.\n\nShe also has a weak side to her once she removes her mask of being an Onee-Sama, what is left is her true side of \"depending\" on a man which is generally Issei and her father Baraqiel after reconciling with him. If danger arises to them, she will become depressed or it can also lead to a rise in her tension. The latter occurred when Issei was injured in the Rating Game between the Sitri and Gremory groups, and the former when Issei was thought to be dead in the Dimensional Gap.\n\nDespite being seductive toward Issei and acting like a mature young woman, Akeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with Issei. However, this still does not stop her being seductive and flirting with Issei. Despite being seen as calm and clear, Akeno does get jealous like the other girls and will fight for Issei. \n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEquipment\n\n\n\n \n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"

He is sealed by Rias as ordered by the elders till she has grown up enough to control him. He still is unable to have a full command on his powers but can improve a lot by drinking Issei's blood.\n\nOriginally a coward and a shut-in, Gasper likes to wear female clothing, claiming that girls' clothes are cute. He also has a penchant for boxes, carrying one with him all the time. When Issei tried to give Gasper confidence, the former gave Gasper a paper bag to put over the latter's face. However, Issei comments that whenever Gasper puts the paper bag on, the latter looks like a molester. As the series progresses, Gasper starts to get more confident and becomes braver.\n\nGasper first appears in Volume 4, after Rias was given permission to unseal him (much to his dismay). He then trains with Issei, Xenovia, and Koneko on how to control his Sacred Gear and with Azazel's advice and Saji's help, improve considerably. During the attack by Khaos Brigade on the leaders of the Three Factions, Gasper was captured and used against his will before being saved by Issei and Rias with Issei using his blood to allow Gasper to control his power as the two of them overpower the female Magicians."

Azazel indicates Ophis has changed because of her interaction with humanity, but how is never described.\n\nSome time in the distant past, Ophis was born in the Dimensional Gap, and lived there as its home. Eventually, long ago, Ophis left the Gap, but when it attempted to return, found that the Great Red had taken up residence there. Before assuming her current form, she used a different guise in the form of an elderly man. At some point before the start of the series, Ophis became the leader of the Khaos Brigade.\n\nOphis' name was mentioned in Volume 4, in which Ddraig calls her \"the strongest existence.\"\n\nShe made her official appearance in Volume 6 in the Underworld to look at the Great Red before retreating.\n\n\n\nIn Volume 13 Extra Life, Ophis is seen playing with Rassei whom she has developed a close relationship with, even going as far as stating that she will train the young Dragon.\n\nAs her name suggests, Ophis has the ability to manifest her powers in the form of snakes. These snakes have the ability to increase a person's power tremendously by consuming it. Another type of snake she creates can be used to bring out a Sacred Gear's full potential. While this can potentially lead them to achieving Balance Breaker more quickly, it can also break the Sacred Gear, killing the host.\n\nAccording to Ddraig, her true abilities are stronger than the two Heavenly Dragons combined. So much so that when her powers are reduced to level twice as powerful as the Heavenly Dragons, she feels \"weak.\"\n\nOphis is a true shapeshifter, able to alter her size, apparent age, physical attributes/characteristics, and even her apparent gender.\n\n\nOphis can \"bless\" people, granting them certain advantages. These blessings don't seem to be of a type to negatively affect Devils. With Asia, the blessing has increased her compatibility with Dragons, while with Irina, it has increased her luck.\n\n(Source: Highschool DxD Wiki)"

He was given the title of the Monkey King at some point before the series but decided to leave the mountain and join the Khaos Brigade, becoming a member of the Vali Team.\n\nBikou is a Senjutsu and Youjutsu user and a powerful fighter, as he was able to withstand Tannin's flame with little injuries (Tannin was also holding back at the time). He also carries a staff that can extend and retract in size and length, similar to his ancestor's legendary Ruyi Jingu Bang, and can summon a golden cloud that he can ride on.\n\n(Source: Highschool DxD Wikia)"

He has a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve, an example being finding a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, he isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister. His biggest attribute is his ability to empathize with anyone, even demons.\n\n\n(Source: Kimetsu no Yaiba Wiki)"

She wears a white short sleeve dress and has a small horn on the right side of her forehead and has white, long, choppy, unkempt hair. She also has red eyes. Under her bandages, her arms are shown to have numerous scars.\n\nHer relationship with Chisaki and the Eight Precepts suggest that she has never felt affection in her life. As she has claimed up until now, Izuku's touch was the first time she felt kindness, which overwhelmed her. When murderous intents are directed at her, she does not scream, nor cry and simply remains silent, because instead of bracing for the pain, she knows she has no choice but to accept.\n\nEri is, however, willing to let herself go with Chisaki in order to protect those that help her. She feels guilt over other people being hurt in order to rescue her.\n\nEri is the granddaughter of the ex-Capo of the Yakuza group, The Eight Precepts of Death. At a young age, she accidentally used her newly manifested Quirk on her father and it caused him to vanish. Her Quirk resembled neither of her parents' so her mother believed her existence to be cursed and gave the girl up to her father. Her grandfather then left her in the care of his protege, Kai Chisaki, so that he could test her to identify her Quirk as well be able to sympathize as it seemed as if they had similar Quirks. However, her Quirk was misdiagnosed and was in fact \"Rewind\" and not \"Vanish.\"\n\nChisaki took over the organization and then began to experiment on Eri to turn her Quirk into a weapon. Through unknown means, he discovered that her blood had properties that suppress the bodies' ability to manifest \"Quirk Factor,\" inhibiting someone's Quirk. He manufactured them into bullets that can be shot at a target and inject them with her blood. He did this by destroying Eri with his Quirk, collecting blood, and then repairing her. He did this hundreds upon thousands of times, despite Eri's pain. Eri tried to escape and resist many times but to no avail and eventually accepted her fate as a prisoner.\n\n\n(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wikia)"
